# NAME
    hsh - A simple Unix shell implementation

# SYNOPSIS
    **hsh**

# DESCRIPTION
    The `hsh` shell is a simple implementation of a Unix-like shell that can execute commands,
    manage environment variables, and perform basic shell operations.

# OPTIONS
    No command-line options are currently supported.

# USAGE
    The `hsh` shell can be used interactively or non-interactively.

## Interactive Mode
    Run the shell executable and enter commands at the prompt.

    ```shell
    $ ./hsh
    #GshellX$ /bin/ls
    hsh main.c shell.c
    #GshellX$ exit
    ```

## Non-Interactive Mode
    Use input redirection to provide commands to the shell.

    ```shell
    $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
    hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
    ```

# BUILT-IN COMMANDS
    The following built-in commands are supported:
    - `exit`: Exit the shell
    - `env`: Print environment variables
    - `setenv VAR VALUE`: Set an environment variable
    - `unsetenv VAR`: Unset an environment variable

# ENVIRONMENT
    The `hsh` shell uses the following environment variables:
    - `PATH`: Colon-separated list of directories for executable searching

# FILES
    - `builtin_functions.c`: Implementation of built-in commands
    - `builtin_finder.c`: Function to find built-in commands
    - `main_shell.c`: Entry point and main loop of the shell
    - `environment_functions.c`: Environment-related functions
    - `print_functions.c`: Functions for character and string output
    - `simple_shell.h`: Header file with function prototypes and structures
    - `strings_functions.c`: String manipulation functions
    - `tok_execute_realloc_free.c`: Tokenization, execution, memory functions

# RETURN VALUES
    The `hsh` shell returns 0 on successful execution. Non-zero values may indicate errors.
